# Talks
A repo containing all of the slides for some of the talks I have done (either by myself or with a team) at conferences, hackathons or beyond. Please feel free to reuse the slides if you like them, I don't require attribution although it would be nice. Please source any external resources used if you do (and if I have forgotten to do so)
